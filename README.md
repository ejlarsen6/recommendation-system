Recommendation System using Letterboxd data

#### Project Status: In-progress

## Description
Using data I had previously acquired using selenium and BeautifulSoup in my [Letterboxd data analysis](https://github.com/ejlarsen6/Letterboxd_analysis) project, I constructed a recommendation system based on a user's last watched and liked films. The system can take a list of users as input and output combined recommendations for both, using the most recently watched movies for each user to fuel the predictions.

## Methods and Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Webscraping:** BeautifulSoup
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, cosine_similarity)

## Results
* Functional and effective recommender algorithm after the input of any number of letterboxd usernames
* Cool tool to decide what movies people might want to watch together
